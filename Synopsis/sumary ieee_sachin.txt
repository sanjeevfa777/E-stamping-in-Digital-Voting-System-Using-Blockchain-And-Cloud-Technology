The paper titled "Towards A Privacy-Preserving Voting System Through Blockchain Technologies" proposes a secure electronic voting system using blockchain technology. The authors address the issues of fairness, independence, transparency, and security in the voting process.

The traditional paper-based voting system is prone to various security issues such as booth capturing, ballot paper stealing, and unfair counting. While electronic voting machines (EVMs) have provided some solutions to these problems, they still face security challenges, such as vote manipulation and tampering.

To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the use of blockchain technology in the voting system. Blockchain provides data integrity, anonymity of voters, privacy, and security. The system utilizes the Ethereum blockchain network and creates an Ethereum account for each voter. Voters can cast their votes either through a smartphone or at a designated voting center.

The proposed system incorporates two-step verification, where voters authenticate themselves and their votes are verified by consensus observers representing the election candidates. If any irregularities are detected, the votes can be declined. This ensures the privacy and security of the voting process.

The authors discuss related works in the field of blockchain-based voting systems and highlight the limitations of existing approaches. They present the architecture and design of their proposed system, emphasizing the use of blockchain to provide a secure and transparent voting environment.

Overall, the paper aims to enhance the security and privacy of electronic voting systems by leveraging blockchain technology. It proposes a novel approach to address the challenges associated with traditional and electronic voting methods.

The research paper on the Voting Algorithm and its Application in Intrusion Tolerant System discusses a voting algorithm designed to improve the accuracy and output of voting systems, particularly in intrusion-tolerant systems. The algorithm is based on testing information and historical record values. It aims to immediately extract runtime error messages from the memory and arithmetic logic unit, combining them with the historical record values of copy-computers to improve voting accuracy.

The paper identifies shortcomings in the commonly used Large Number Voting strategy, such as high failure rates and inflexible voting parameters. It then presents an improved algorithm that addresses these shortcomings. The algorithm calculates the voting contribution value for each copy, divides the voting results, and selects the set with the largest collection as the voting set. The final voting output is determined based on the prior contribution values and the response results of the copies.

To further enhance the algorithm, the paper introduces detection codes to extract service running information during the voting process. This information becomes the basis for copy response results. The algorithm considers both the detection information and the recently history records of copies in each round of voting to determine the voting output. It also incorporates a threshold to judge the consistency between copies' input values.

The experimental results compare the performance of the improved algorithm with the Majority Voting algorithm based on copy reliable weight. The experiments are conducted in an intrusion-tolerant system environment using multiple servers. The results show that the improved algorithm outperforms the Majority Voting algorithm in terms of successful voting numbers, even in the presence of errors.

The research paper highlights the importance of intrusion-tolerant systems and the role of voting algorithms in ensuring system integrity and continuous service. The proposed algorithm offers a more accurate and reliable approach to voting, considering both real-time faults and historical records. It provides insights into improving voting systems' performance and is suitable for intrusion-tolerant systems.

The paper titled "ID Based Signature Schemes for Electronic Voting" proposes the use of ID-based signature schemes for electronic voting systems. The authors suggest the use of two ID-based signature schemes to ensure the security, anonymity, and verifiability of votes.

The main challenges in electronic voting systems include the need for unforgeable votes, voter anonymity, and the ability for voters to verify that their votes have been counted correctly. The proposed scheme addresses these challenges using ID-based signatures.

The paper describes a designated verifier ring signature scheme, which ensures the security and anonymity of votes. In this scheme, a group of voters (e.g., board members or shareholders) each signs their vote and designates the Voting Authority as the verifier. The Voting Authority can verify the votes' authenticity without knowing the exact person who voted, thus maintaining anonymity.

To allow voters to check if their votes have been taken into account, the paper proposes an ID-based designated verifier signature scheme for generating receipts. The Receipt Generator, using an ID-based scheme, provides a receipt to the voter, which proves that their vote has been recorded without revealing the actual vote to a third party.

The paper provides a detailed explanation of the proposed ID-based signature schemes and discusses their security properties. It also mentions related work in the field of electronic voting systems and ID-based signatures.

Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to address the challenges in electronic voting systems using ID-based signature schemes. It provides a secure and anonymous voting scheme while allowing voters to verify the correctness of their votes through receipts.

The paper titled "Electronic Voting based on Virtual ID of Aadhar using Blockchain Technology "discusses the use of blockchain technology in an electronic voting system that is based on the Virtual ID (VID) of Aadhaar, an identification system used in India. The goal is to ensure the security and integrity of the voting process and prevent tampering with votes.

The proposed system involves the integration of Aadhaar's VID, which is a unique identifier, with the e-voting system. During the registration process, users provide their VID, and the system retrieves their demographic details, including fingerprint data, from the Aadhaar database. The fingerprint is then processed and converted into a digital signature to ensure the integrity of the vote.

The voting process involves users casting their votes online using their VID and scanning their fingerprint for authentication. The vote is encrypted using asymmetric encryption, where the election commission's public key is used for encryption and their private key is used for decryption. The encrypted vote is stored in a block in the blockchain.

The blockchain ensures the security and integrity of the votes by using hashing techniques. Each block in the blockchain contains data, the hash of the block, and the hash of the previous block. The hash function helps detect any changes to the block, and the blockchain structure ensures that once a block is added, it is difficult to modify.

The properties of the proposed blockchain e-voting system using VID are discussed. The system provides authentication, availability, public verifiability, and integrity. The SHA-256 algorithm is mentioned as one of the hashing algorithms used to ensure integrity.

In conclusion, the paper suggests that integrating blockchain technology with Aadhaar's VID can provide a secure and tamper-proof electronic voting system. The use of fingerprint data, digital signatures, and hashing techniques enhances the security and integrity of the votes. However, it's important to note that the implementation and effectiveness of such a system would depend on various factors, including the robustness of the underlying technology and the regulatory framework.
